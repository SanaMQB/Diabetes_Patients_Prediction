# Diabetes Patient Prediction using Python and Machine Learning

## Project Description:
### Data Source: 
Utilized a dataset originally sourced from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
### Objective: 
Developed a machine learning model to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes or not based on various health-related features.
### Methodology: 
Employed Python programming language for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model development. Implemented a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, a popular machine learning technique for binary classification.

## Key Responsibilities:
### Data Preprocessing: 
Cleaned and prepared the dataset, handling missing values, and encoding categorical features.
### Feature Engineering: 
Engineered relevant features, transforming and scaling data where necessary.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Conducted comprehensive EDA to gain insights into data distributions, correlations, and patterns, enabling better feature selection.
### Model Development: 
Developed, fine-tuned, and optimized a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for diabetes prediction.
### Model Evaluation: 
Employed cross-validation techniques to assess model performance, including metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## Results:
Achieved a model with high predictive accuracy, precision, and recall, providing valuable insights for diabetes diagnosis.

## Technologies Used:
Python, Jupyter Notebook, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

## Challenges Overcome:
Dealt with imbalanced data and implemented techniques like oversampling or undersampling to address this issue.
Fine-tuned hyperparameters of the SVM model to optimize predictive performance.

## Future Work:
Potential improvements include incorporating more advanced machine learning techniques and expanding the dataset for more accurate predictions.

## Lessons Learned:
Gained experience in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, and the importance of model evaluation.
